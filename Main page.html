<h1 class="heading"> THE MYANMAR (BURMA) CIVIL WAR</h1>

    <p class="text">Imagine you are sleeping on the dirt floor of the jungle ground at 7:00 AM. Now imagine you hear a loud explosion that darts you out of your partial nap that you have had for the day. You're adreniline is pumping you and your fellow fighters spring up, You and your fellow fighters grab your rifles, and sprint out of the covering of your camp. You are never certian that you will make it to return to your makeshift sleepingbag on the jungles dirt floor. Only to do it again at a time you dont get to pick.</p>

    <p class="text">This is what its like to be a young adult in myanmar.</p>

<h2 class="heading">ABOUT THE CREATOR AND CREATION</h2>

    <p class="text">My name is Dominic, I am an 18 year old freshman in college for Data Science. At the time of making this website, I was given a prompt on an assignment that sparked this idea; "What current issue, problem, or topic does your website cover?". I thought to myself; "I dont know of any current issues that I can think of". And then it hit me, the war people refer to as the "forgotten war", the war that is being entirely crowd funded, and the war for a nations future, freedom, and indipendence. And that nation is none other than Myanmar (Burma). If I described that first part to you face to face and asked you to name where I was talking about, you probabaly would'nt be able to.</p>

    <p class="text">And thats the issue, thats why I created this website because a civil war for indipendence is going on AT THIS MOMENT and no one mentions it. I made this to not only raise awareness but to help you understand that, these people are slightly younger and slightly older than me. And our day to day lives are DRASTICALLY different. Young adults my age shouldn't have to be fighting for freedom or worrying about when they will sleep or eat next, or even if one day they will even be free or here to see it.</p>

    <p class="text">So please let hours and hours of my work inform you and open your eyes to the daily struggles, of real people, in the real world, right now.</p>

<h2 class="heading">THE BEGINNING</h2>
<img src="myanmar protets.png" alt="sac spray protesters" class="textimage1">

    <p class="text">Febuary 1st, 2021, A military coup known as the "Tamadaw", successfully overthrow the Democratic Government in a hostile takeover and form a "State Administration Council" and their army refered to as the "Junta". After the takeover, They declared that the November 2020 election results were invalid, proceded to arrest the top officials of the government on fake charges of fraud, And then declared a 1-year State of Emergency and cut most communications. The people of Myanmar were very understandably not happy about this, so they took to the streets to peacefully protest about it. The militaries response? Brutally put it down by gassing, flashing, and shooting at protesters.</p>

    <p class="text">After this event the people understood the militaries mindset. So the people got angry. By late March 2021, dozens of protesters had travelled to Myanmar's border areas to enlist in and train under one of the country's many insurgent groups. People who stayed,  began arming themselves with homemade weapons in an attempt to defend themselves against attacks by the military. The "Peoples Defence Force" and The "National Unity Government" were created and consisted of about 65,000 members. Along with the help of; the "Arakan Army", the "Ta'ang National Liberation Army", the "Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army", and the "Chinland National Defence Force". Each fighter, a human wanting freedom. </p>

<h2 class="heading">THE PUSHBACK</h2>
<img src="myanmar pg 1.png" alt="ambush from pdf on a sac convoy" class="textimage2">
    <p class="text">April 24th, 2021, the Chinland National Defence Force (CDF), Launch an ambush on the State Administration Council (SAC) in Mindat. This would begin two long battles and conflict in Mindat untill August 2022. And Mindat still continues to be a site of conflict. The Battle of Mindat became the first large-scale armed conflict arising from the 2021 coup. As a response, the Junta (SAC Forces) cut off food and water supplies and declared martial law on the 26th of April. On the 27th, There was a ceasefire. The Junta had released seven important activists. But, on the condition that their forces be allowed in Mindat. The CDF deined this and the fighting continued on May 12th, as the Juntas still held five more activists. </p>

    <p class="text">Unfortunately, The SAC would go on to win this battle and as a result, increasing levels of sexual violence against women and looting of property were reported.</p>

    <p class="text">However, by the end of 2021 the SAC could no longer supress the anger of the people, and the PDF at this time had captured police stations, outposts, and military-owned businesses. They were growing in power, and with the help of the NUG and the EAO. The rebels recieved proper training and weapons and were ready to fight for real this time.</p>

<h2 class="heading">THE REGIMES TRUE COLORS</h2>
<img src="sac crimes.png" alt="the rubble after a SAC raid on a village" class="textimage4">
    <p class="text">It is now May 2022, and things are looking up for the PDF fighters. At this time a solid 65% of Myanmar is under control by the PDF, and the Regime is panicing. But, being forced back to their bases, the SAC was going to do whatever it took to gain their footing back and they meant anything.</p>

    <p class="text">May 11th, 2022, The SAC deploys it's "counterinsurgency methods", mortar rounds are shot into The Mondaingbin Village. Following the bombardment, ground forces proceeded to eneter the villages Buddhist Monastery and take 37 young men hostage before executing them and other prisoners infront of a stupa. This would be known as the "Mon Taing Pin massacre". But the SAC didn't stop at that.</p>

    <p class="text">July 23rd, 2022, The SAC announces that they have executed political prisoners Zayar Thaw and Kyaw Min Yu, which was the first use of capital punishment in Myanmar for the first time in 40 years.</p>

    <p class="text">August 2022, The SAC raid Se Zin village in August 2022, They set fire to more than 400 homes with at least 15 people killed imediately. Then, detained about 400 people in and around Se Zin, and about 100 of them have been killed, while others died in the horrible prsion conditions.</p>

    <p class="text">September 16th 2022, class was in session at a monastic school near Maha Dhammayanthi Monastery in Let Yet Kone. The school teaches 250 students from kindergarten to the eighth grade, from Let Yet Kone and other nearby villages. At 1PM the SAC used Mi-35 helicopters to airstrike the school. The helicopters shelled the school grounds for 45 minutes, firing rockets and machine guns as students scattered to hide, after the artillery was done, ground forces launched an infantry attack. SAC Air Force troops killed at least 13 civilians, including 8 children. While the ground unit killed 157 children that survived the initial artillery fire. The event was known as The "Let Yet Kone massacre", and became one of Myanmar's deadliest civilian massacre involving children.</p>

    <p class="text">The SAC however, ended these "counterinsurgency plans" in September 2022. As The PDF and assisting armies were not phased. They continued to press on, and on September 24th, 2022, retired Brigadier General Ohn Thwin, mentor to State Administration Council vice-chairman Senior General Soe Win was assassinated by anti-SAC guerilla groups, after the PDF guerrilla fighters ambushed his transport in Yangon. He was shot dead, along with his son-in-law Ye Tayza, a former army captain in Yangon, becoming the highest-ranking junta target killed by resistance groups. He was accused of supporting the junta and encouraging the military to kill people who were against the coup.</p>

    <p class="text">This assassination caused an increase in security on high-ranking SAC personnel. And made it very clear to the SAC that the rebelion wasnt going anywhere, and everyone was willing to make a sacrifice for a better future in Myanmar.</p>

<h2 class="heading">THE TURNING POINT</h2>
<img src="myanmar p 1.png" alt="A SAC Members Gear" class="textimage">
    <p class="text">In mid-October 2022, The SAC used more anti-rebelion demotivation methods by setting fire to atleast 20 villages in the region and many victims of these attacks ended up joining the fight. The KNDF (Karenni Nationalities Defense Force) claimed in January 2023 that 1,692 regime troops and 211 resistance fighters were killed since the 2021 coup, 293 civilians had been killed by the regime, and 126 displaced civilians died while fleeing their homes in Kayah and Shan states in 2022.</p>

    <p class="text">On October 21st, 2022, The Karen National Liberation Army stepped up fighting, besieging the major town of Kawkareik on the Thai border. The battle began with surprise attacks on the Asia Highway and at government offices within the town. But, they failed to capture the town due to the main issue throughout this entire war for them. They dont have the technology that the military has. They ultimately withdrew two days later, after facing junta air strikes and strategically drawing junta troops away from nearby positions. However, Four days later, undeterred KNLA-led forces seized a Junta Light Infantry Battalion base in the Kyain Seikgyi Township. Showing the SAC how relentless and unwavierd the rebels truely were.</p>

    <p class="text">A series of pop-up rebel attacks would follow on the Junta from the PDF for this, In November 2022, resistance in the Bago Region increased. In the Monyo Township, in the western Bago Region, the PDF attacked a police building using cluster bombs. 15 junta soldiers were killed in this attack. in a following raid from the PDF, a raid on a police station in the Yedashe Township. Giving thousands of civilians the chance to flee Shwegyin Township, as joint KNLA and NUG-led resistance forces seized three military outposts.in the town.</p>

    <p class="text">In early January 2023, PDF groups in Kani Township, Sagaing Region attacked Junta supply ships, killing at least 25 soldiers. The junta increasingly used waterways for supplies, avoiding roadways in resistance-held areas. This attack crippled the supply chain of the Junta, and made it harder for them to access weapons and artillery.</p>

    <p class="text">This pressure from the rebels had seemed to be working, On November 26th, 2022, the Junta and the Akranian Army had made a temorary ceasefire agreement due to humanitarian reasons.</p>
    
<h2 class="heading">OPERATION 1027: A BEACON OF HOPE</h2> 
<img src="myanmar p 3.png" alt="a group of myanmar rebels getting ready to ambush a convoy" class="textimage3">
    <p class="text">October 27th, 2023. The "Three Brotherhood Alliance" consisting of the "Arakan Army", the "Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army", and the "Ta'ang National Liberation Army" launch "Operation 1027". The plan is to attack Junta checkpoints and bases near Lashio and the Phaung Seik border trade post near Chinshwehaw. Over the course of 3 days the coalition was able to capture 57 Junta bases in the region.</p>

    <p class="text">October 20th, 2023, The PDF and TNLA successfully liberate the town of Nawnghkio, and in the process capturing 41 surrendering Junta soldiers in the same region. The following day saw PDF fighters successfully capturing the "Gangdau Yang" base on the Myitkyina-Bhamo road. A junta convoy came the next day to reinforce but, the TNLA and PDF forces blew up an armored car, they took weapons and freeed POWs, and fored the SAC convy to retreat. This base was extremely important to the SAC in terms of strategy and they suffered a hard blow with the siezing of this base </p>

    <p class="text">On November 6th, 2023, the TNLA forces successfully seize bridges and road gates near Namhkam and Shan State, liberating the town after a three-day assault. Kawlin also saw liberation from the coalition. Marking the first district-level capital seized during the operation. A GIGANTIC success for the PDF forces and over the next three days. The coalition took the towns of; Khampat, Kunlong and Monekoe across the northern region of Myanmar. And were able to re-establish local government functions after securing the towns.</p>

    <p class="text">November 17th, 2023 saw the first loss of Operation 1027 when the TNLA captured the Sakhan Thit Kone base in Namhkam Township. But, lost it to a junta offensive the following day. However, this wasn't because they were out-gunned fairly. The TNLA accused the Junta of using chemical weapon bombs during the counter-siege. Which is something the SAC definitely had in their posession being Burmas former military.</p>

    <p class="text">On November 29th 2023, the Shan State Progress Party (SSPP) and the Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS) declared a truce between their respective armies in response to the Operation. The SSPP stated that the 2 armies "intended to unite as one in the future."</p>

    <p class="text"> And for the cherry on top to this whole opperation, In early December 2023, the Tatmadaw allegedly reached out to China for it to assert pressure on the Three Brotherhood Alliance and for them to stop Operation 1027. On the 11th of December 2023, China helped to hold peace talks between the Tatmadaw and various rebel groups, including the Brotherhood Alliance. The Brotherhood Alliance announced later on December 13th that these peace talks "lasted only 10 minutes" and "vowed to continue fighting".</p>

<h2 class="heading">WHERE WE ARE NOW</h2>
    <p class="text"> at the time of writing this it is July 20th, 2024 and the current state of the war is looking good for the rebels, with about 60% of the nation being in rebel control. And with the many various rebel victories this year such as the; "Fall of Mrauk U", Operation 1027 (part 2), and Operation 0307. The Tamadaw are starting to lose their grip on the nation. But that doesn't mean the fight is over. It is true that the Junta have had a lot of their technology used/destoryed so far in this war, but that seems to be the only thing stopping these rebels from finding their freedom. They are citizens who have to scavenge and survive using whatever they can to fight. And the SAC is an established, organized, and pre-funded military with a powerful arsenal.</p>

<h2 class="heading">"WHY SHOULD I CARE?"</h2>
    <p class="text">You might have asked yourself this question during the viewing of this page, be it for personal or objective reasons. You should care because this is something we havent seen in a long time. A country shouldn't be opressed by its government today, a countries citizens shouldnt have to fight tooth and nail to live like most of us today, a young adult my age shouldnt have to worry about being shot at, at the same time I worry about the due date of this project.</p>

    <p class="text">These are real people. Who have had to get up every day and put their life on the line just as the service members of the armed forces of the world have. But not for the defense of established freedom. For established freedom.</p>

    <p class="text">One thing I have mentioned quite a bit has been the technological disadvantage the rebels have been at throughout this whole war. Thats where you come in, the viewer. I will say it again, this ENTIRE rebel movement is CROWD FUNDED. These humans rely on your generious tip of even a dollar to fund and supply their fight for a better life.</p>
